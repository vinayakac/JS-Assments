# Types, Values, and Variables

- Types :

The kinds of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language are known as types,

- Variable :

A variable defines a symbolic name for a value and allows the value to be referred to by name.

## JavaScript types can be divided into two categories:

* primitive types

JavaScriptâ€™s primitive types include numbers, strings of text (known as strings), and Boolean truth values (known as booleans).

The special JavaScript values ***null*** and ***undefined*** are primitive values,

* object types 

An object (that is, a member of the type object) is a collection of properties
where each property has a name and a value (either a primitive value, such as a number or string, or an object).

- Primitive and objects can also be categorized as **mutable** and **immutable** types.

* Mutable : A value of a mutable type can change.(Ex : arrays, objects)

* Immutables : Numbers, booleans, null, and undefined are immutable

> JavaScript variables are untyped: you can assign a value of any type to a variable, and you can later assign a value of a different type to the same variable.

> Variables are declared with the ***var*** keyword.

> JavaScript uses lexical scoping.

  * Variables declared out-side of a function are global variables and are visible everywhere in a JavaScript program.

  * Variables declared inside a function have function scope and are visible only to code that appears inside that function.
