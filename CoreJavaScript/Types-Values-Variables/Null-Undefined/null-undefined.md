# null and undefined

null is a language keyword that evaluates to a special value that is usually used to indicate the **absence** of a value.

## undefined 

 JavaScript also has a second value that indicates absence of value. The undefined value represents a deeper kind of absence. It is the value of variables that have not been initialized and the value you get when you query the value of an object property or array element that does not exist.


You might consider undefined to represent a system-level, unexpected, or error-like absence of value 
 
null to represent program-level, normal, or expected absence of
value.
