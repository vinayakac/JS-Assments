# Assesment 

1. Comparision to perform boolen values 


if (a == 4)

b = b + 1;

else

a = a + 1;

This code checks whether a equals 4. If so, it adds 1 to b; otherwise, it adds 1 to a.

2. The && operator performs the Boolean AND operation. It evaluates to a truthy value if and only if both of its operands are truthy; it evaluates to a falsy value otherwise.

if ((x == 0 && y == 0) || !(z == 0)) {
// x and y are both zero or z is non-zero
}
