# Boolean Values

A boolean value represents truth or falsehood, on or off, yes or no. There are only two possible values of this type. The reserved words true and false evaluate to these
two values.

For example:

a == 4

This code tests to see whether the value of the variable a is equal to the number 4. If it is, the result of this comparison is the boolean value true. If a is not equal to 4, the result of the comparison is false.
