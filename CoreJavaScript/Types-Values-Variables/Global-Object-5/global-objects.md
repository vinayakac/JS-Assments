# Global Object

The global object is a regular JavaScript object that serves a very important purpose: the properties of this object are the globally defined symbols that are available to a JavaScript program.

* global properties like undefined, Infinity, and NaN
* global functions like isNaN(), parseInt() (ยง3.8.2), and eval() (ยง4.12).
* constructor functions like Date(), RegExp(), String(), Object(), and Array()
(ยง3.8.2)
* global objects like Math and JSON (ยง6.9)

Ex : var global = this;  // Define a global variable to refer to the global object
