# Identifiers and Reserved Words

- An identifier is simply a name. In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name variables and functions and to provide labels for certain loops in JavaScript code.

- A JavaScript identifier must begin with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).
Example:
* i
* my_variable_name
* v13
* _dummy
* $str
