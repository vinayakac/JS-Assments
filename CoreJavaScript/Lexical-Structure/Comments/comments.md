JavaScript supports two styles of comments.
1.Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by JavaScript.

2.Any text between the characters /* and */ is also treated as a comment;

Example:
// This is a single-line comment.
/* This is also a comment */ 

// Look up the input and output elements in the document
var amount = document.getElementById("amount");

catch(e) { /* And ignore those errors */ }
