Optional Semicolons:

-JavaScript uses the semicolon (;) to separate statements (see Chapter 5) from each other.

-use semicolons to explicitly mark the ends of statements, even where they are not required.

Consider the following code. Since the two statements appear on separate lines, the
first semicolon could be omitted:
a = 3;
b = 4;

-Consider the following code:
var a
a
=
3
console.log(a)

-JavaScript interprets this code like this:
var a; a = 3; console.log(a);

Ex :2

var y = x + f
(a+b).toString()

JavaScript interprets the code like this:
var y = x + f(a+b).toString();


Ex : 3

x
++
y

It is parsed as x; ++y;, not as x++; y.
